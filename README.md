# typerace

A typing game made using the Ebitengine for Go!

This is very much a WIP to play around with the `ebitengine`.

## WebAssembly Support

To start the game from a browser locally,  you must have docker installed.

- `make docker/build`
- `make docker/run`

In your browser, head to http://localhost:8080.
